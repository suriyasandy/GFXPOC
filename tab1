    st.subheader("📌 Business Use Case")
    st.markdown("""
    In institutional FX markets, trades are monitored for **rate deviations** from market benchmarks.
    A key component of this is **volatility thresholding**, which helps:
    - Flag trades with excessive deviation.
    - Ensure fairness, reduce risk, and maintain compliance.
    """)

    st.subheader("📉 Manual Approach (Baseline)")
    st.markdown("""
    - Currencies are bucketed into 4 fixed groups (based on average volatility).
    - Annualized OHLC volatility from vendors like Reuters is **converted to daily** using:
      ```
      daily_vol = ohlc_vol / √252
      ```
    - Then mapped to group thresholds:
      - Group 1: < 0.07 → Threshold = 0.10
      - Group 2: < 0.50 → Threshold = 0.25
      - Group 3: < 0.60 → Threshold = 0.55
      - Group 4: ≥ 0.60 → Threshold = 0.80

    **Limitation**:
    - Thresholds are fixed and lag behind real-time volatility changes.

    st.subheader("📊 Our Dynamic Volatility Computation")
    st.markdown("""
    We compute volatility using **log returns of Close prices**, capturing actual price movements:

    ```
    log_return = log(Close_t / Close_t-1)
    volatility = rolling_std(log_return) * √252
    ```

    **Example**:
    - Close Prices: 100, 102, 101
    - Log Return Day 2: log(102 / 100) = 0.0198
    - Log Return Day 3: log(101 / 102) = -0.0098
    - Rolling volatility is computed over a 60-day window and annualized.

    This method:
    - Reflects true market volatility dynamics.
    - Enables **adaptive thresholding** using models like GARCH, EVT, and smile logic.

    st.subheader("🚀 Our Enhanced Dynamic Approach")
    st.markdown("""
    We simulate and compare **multiple thresholding methods**:
    - 📈 GARCH: Captures volatility clustering.
    - 🔺 EVT: Models extreme tail behavior.
    - 🧠 Smile-based logic: Uses implied volatility structure (ATM, RR, BF).
    - 🔁 Cross-pair thresholds and weekly recalibration simulation.

    All methods are:
    - Transparent & explainable.
    - Visualized for easy comparison.
    - Built for weekly or real-time updates.
